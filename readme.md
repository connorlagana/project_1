I plan on taking financial news from the Stock News Api while also taking financial data from Intrinio

## Stretch Goals

Previously mentioned, coming up with a way to show companies that the users is searching for (updated in real time)

I've never actually used a JavaScript Library before. Lucky for me theres a ton of them that all look like they could be helpful. Learning this is a new experience for me.
